                <h4>What is BlockFrame?</h4>
                <p>
                    At BlockFrame, I worked on the Philos project, which focuses on creating secure, decentralized systems for document security and supply chain management. 
                    Working in a fully remote and decentralized environment was an exciting challenge.

                <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the highlights was learning Go on the fly and using it to build production-ready backend services. Collaborating with the CTO, I helped design validation and testing models that enhanced system accuracy and reliability.
                    Developing software with a strong focus on cybersecurity best practices at every step was an invaluable experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was rewarding to balance new technologies, solve challenging problems, and ensure that everything worked as expected behind the scenes.
