                    <h3>What is My Portfolio?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I’ve been building my own portfolio site using C#, Blazor, and a bit of JavaScript. This page is designed to highlight what I’ve accomplished in both tech and music. It’s been a great learning experience, allowing me to dive into features like implementing dark mode, creating and using SVGs on webpages, and building a clean single-page layout with links at the top for easy navigation.

                <p>
                    This project has been a fun and rewarding way to showcase my skills while learning new techniques. From implementing responsive designs with Bootstrap to integrating external APIs for dynamic content, I’ve gained valuable experience in creating a polished and functional site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The process of combining features like dark mode, custom SVGs, and WordPress API integration has been an excellent opportunity to explore modern web development tools and practices.
